“NeaNaf” is a game about dealing with… never ending attacks. It’s an arena action game where you must defeat a constant swarm of enemies to gain coins that after being captured will give you a random special ability to help you keep fighting. As you play, your only thought in mind, to keep on going… now and forever.

This was the first game I ever released. I released it on the Play store, a free and paid version. I was inspired by going to Pax East the year before and feeling that it’s possible for me to become a game developer.
