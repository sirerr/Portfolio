Catopia was a project that we worked on during HVRE 2018. The goal was that year get into the newest type of immersion, AR. That year we did something way different, we decided to run the group as a game studio with the goal of releasing in a year.

I was given the job of Project Lead. I helped in making decisions about design, platforms, also ran the Audio team and towards the end, did modeling and some animation.

We took elements from VR and brought them to AR as well like grabbing objects with your phone since we donâ€™t have a controller.

The game was released to the Play Store on New Years Day, we met our goal.
