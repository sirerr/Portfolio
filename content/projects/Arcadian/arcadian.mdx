This project was done in connection with the University of Kentucky. The goal of the project is to create a calming VR game that will help children during chemo treatment.

Users are able to start by putting in their initials then how they are feeling. After that, they choose games to play and the goal is to see if after playing these games, the user feels better while during the whole time receiving treatment that could be painful.

I was the lead developer on the project. I had input from the researchers at the university about look and design. This project is internal and isnâ€™t being used to earn money outside of UK.
