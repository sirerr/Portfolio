Mortimer’s Mansion is a survival horror puzzle game for the HTC Vive. The player wakes in a library, forced to solve puzzles to escape. Can you find your way out in time?

Mortimer’s Mansion is a horror puzzle game set inside an old mansion. The player is taunted by their host, Mortimer. Puzzles are randomly generated so that each player gets a different experience.

This game was made by a community group called HVRE – Hands-on Virtual Reality Experience – helping people gain experience making VR/AR/ and other alternate realities. Mortimer’s Mansion was shown publicly at Lex Play Game Convention in 2016.

On the project I was second in command to the Team Lead. I helped with the level design, system design and programming.

Plans for releasing the game to the public are still underway.
